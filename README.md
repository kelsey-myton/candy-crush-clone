This project is a simple clone of the popular puzzle game Candy Crush. Players can match three or more candies in a row to score points and progress through levels. The game includes basic features such as swapping adjacent candies, cascading matches, and a score system.

Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project was great for learning about grid manipulation, event handling, game logic, and drag and drop in web development.
